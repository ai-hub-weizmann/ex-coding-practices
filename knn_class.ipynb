    "\n",
    "A Python package is a way of organizing related Python code into a directory hierarchy. Most of the tools that you use in Python like NumPy, Pandas are organized as Python packages. Packages can be installed using package managers like pip, and are often distributed through the Python Package Index [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). This system allows Python developers to easily share and reuse code across projects and with the wider Python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pyproject.toml` file was introduced in [PEP 518](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/).  It is the configuration file for a package. It is used to specify the project's dependencies, build system, and other configuration options. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This section specifies specifies the build backend to be used. A build backend for a Python package is a tool or system that handles the process of building, packaging, and preparing your Python project for distribution. Here we will use default Hatchling as a build backend  - so you can let this section as is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. `[project]` section\n",
    "\n",
    "This section specifies the project's metadata. You can fill the following fields:\n",
    "- `name`: the name of the project (as it will appear when you want to install it with pip)\n",
    "- `version`: the version of the project\n",
    "- `description`: a one-line description of the project\n",

    "\n",
    "In this last part, we have to specify the details of external tools that we'll need. For our project, we want to do **linting**. Linting is the process of checking the source code for programmatic and stylistic errors. Linters are tools that perform static analysis on your code to find potential errors, bugs, and stylistic issues. Linters can help you catch bugs early in the development process, and ensure that your code is clean, readable, and maintainable. In our case, we will use `ruff`. Let's have a short overview of this tool before filling the `[tool]` section."
